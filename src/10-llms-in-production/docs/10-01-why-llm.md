## Why LLMs have captured the attention of the world

### When to use LLMs?
- Generating content
- Question answering service
- Chatbots and AI assistants
- Text-to-something problems (e.g. text-to-code, text-to-image, text-to-video)
- Talk-to-your-data
- Anything that can be described in text, involves communication

### Avoid using LLMs
- Latency-sensitive workloads
- Simple projects
- Problems we don’t solve with words but with math or algorithms—forecasting, outlier prediction, calculus, etc.
- Critical evaluations
- High-risk projects

### Buy or Build?
As you can see, there are lots of reasons why a company might want to own and build its own LLMs, including greater control, cutting costs, and meeting security and regulation requirements. Despite this, we understand that buying is easy, and building is much more difficult, so for many projects, it makes sense to buy.

#### Reasons to buy
- Quickly getting up and running to conduct research and prototype use cases
- Easy access to highly optimized production models
- Access to vendors' technical support and systems

#### Reasons to build
- Getting a competitive edge for your business use cases
- Keeping costs low and transparent
- Ensuring the reliability and security of your LLM
- Keeping your data private and safe
- Controlling model outputs on sensitive or private topics
