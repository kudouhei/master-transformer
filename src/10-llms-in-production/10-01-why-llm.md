## Why LLMs have captured the attention of the world

### When to use LLMs?
- Generating content
- Question answering service
- Chatbots and AI assistants
- Text-to-something problems (e.g. text-to-code, text-to-image, text-to-video)
- Talk-to-your-data
- Anything that can be described in text, involves communication

### Avoid using LLMs
- Latency-sensitive workloads
- Simple projects
- Problems we don’t solve with words but with math or algorithms—forecasting, outlier prediction, calculus, etc.
- Critical evaluations
- High-risk projects
